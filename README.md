# Hey Developers 👋 I'm Kumudini
### A Passionate Full-Stack Developer from India ❤️

## 🚀 About Me

Hey there! I’m a **4th-year Computer Science student at NIT Surat** who thrives at the intersection of **design** and **code**.  
With solid frontend chops and full-stack experience, I craft seamless, performant, and beautiful digital experiences.

- 💭 I thrive on curiosity — breaking things, fixing them, and learning in the process  
- 🎨 Design and dev go hand-in-hand for me; I care deeply about how things **look** and **work**  
- 🛠️ Whether it’s crafting APIs or tweaking CSS, I love bringing ideas to life  
- 🎯 When I’m not coding, I’m drawing on my sketchpad, plotting chess moves, or brewing my next cup of coffee ☕

> **Going onwards and upwards — with code, creativity, and caffeine. 🚀**
